Questions:
- How do I apply the learnings from previous lessons such as :
  Compound components
  context
  Render props
  Custom Hooks

I need to think through these decisions to apply what I have learned.

For the Badges:
- challenging myself by using context to pass the color and text props for practice purposes and abstract the code inside the App.jsx
-
